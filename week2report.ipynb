    "# In which neighborhood a Restaurant can be opened?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief Introduction (Cover Page):\n",
    "\n",
    "In Toronto I went to one of my friend's house for dinner and had delicious food. In conversation with her, got to know that she would like to get into restaurant business. She wants her restaurant in a neighborhood so that they get more customers.\n",
    "To suggest her the best neighborhood, below are the few things that I considered along with competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility If restaurant near residential or student living places, it provides better commute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility If it is in a place where there are few other restaurants, shopping malls, grocery stores it gives more visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Crime rate High crime rates can make potential customers uncomfortable. Therefore, if restaurant is in a busy neighborhood surrounded by few other malls or restaurants, less crime rate more customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data We Need\n",
    "We will need geo-locational information about that specific borough and the neighborhoods in that borough. We specifically and technically mean the latitude and longitude numbers of that borough. We assume that it is \"North York\" in Toronto (as she lives near North York).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information, I will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. As basic information, I will can obtain its precise latitude and longitude and its distance from the center of the neighborhood. A typical request from Foursquare will provide us with the following information such as Postal code, neighborhood's latitude and longitude, venue, distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some notes about Foursquare:\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare is a local search-and-discovery service mobile app which provides search results for its users (Wikipedia). Founded: New York City, New York, U.S Users: 60 million Date launched: March 11, 2009 Employees: Over 200 Founders: Dennis Crowley, Naveen Salvadorian Owner: Foursquare Labs, Inc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying Neighborhoods inside \"North York\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Postal Codes of different regions inside North York to find the list of neighborhoods. We will essentially obtain our information from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M and then process the table inside this site. To do this, I have Imported pandas Read html wiki link to tables data frame. I have used pd. read_html. Since wiki page has lot of data that is no need for this capstone, on the browser, right click on wiki page, click on view source code to find class name (wikitable sortable) and passed it to attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing the Retrieved Data and Creating a Data Frame for All the Venues inside the North York:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Foursquare api, got nearby venues and found out how many unique categories are there. Did one hot encoding. Now, the dataset is fully ready to be used for machine learning and statistical analysis purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying one of Machine Learning Techniques (K-Means Clustering)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I clustered neighborhoods via K-means clustering method. I think that 5 clusters are enough and can cover the complexity of our problem. After clustering we will update our dataset and create a column representing the group for each neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Making and Reporting Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Here for North York, I have used 5 clusters (k=5 ie 0,1,2,3,4). If we look at k=3 cluster, M3A zip code has park, decent restaurants and shopping stores. It satisfies above-mentioned criteria like accessibility, visibility and less crime rate. This algorithm although is straightforward yet is strongly powerful.\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "Based on this analysis, the best recommended neighborhood will be: 'Neighborhood': 'Parkwoods', 'Postal Code': 'M3A', 'Neighborhood Latitude': 43.753259, 'Neighborhood Longitude': -79.329656\n",
